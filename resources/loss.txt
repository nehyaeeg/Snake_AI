Your loss means exactly this: for one batch,
 it is the mean-squared error between your 
model's prediction for time t from its sole
 Q-Value approximation and its prediction 
for time t from its Q-Value approximation 
for the next state(t+1) and taking into account
 some "ground truth" from the environment, 
that is the reward (r) for this timestep
