# Snake_AI

This project tries to teach a reinforcement learning model to play the snake game.
states of the game include danger in 3 directions(straight, right left), current direction of the snake and the location
of the food relative to the current location of the snake.
A deep Q network is trained using torch.NN and rssults are displayed.

The books, articles, and images in the resource folder explain the underlying mathematical formulas at play.
